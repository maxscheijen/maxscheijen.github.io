title: Developing Taste by Copying other Peoples Work

I like to copy other peoples work.

Literally copying it, line for line, character by character, by hand, typing it out. And when I'm done, I throw it all out.

## Copying

I type out the work of people I admire, it helps me learn, it helps me reason about my decisions and theirs, it helps me understand their process and mine.
Sometimes it starts small, a function in a codebase, a paragraph in a book. Sometimes its bigger, a full codebase or a chapter in a book.

I want to learn. I want to learn from people that do better work.

I know it sounds silly, just typing out other peoples work, but this habit started really early for me. However I'm not the only one.

Later in life I discovered that other people also do this as well. Like Hunter S. Thompson.

> "If you type out somebody's work, you learn a lot about it. Amazingly it's like music. And from typing out parts of Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald - these were writers that were very big in my life and the lives of the people around me - so yea I wanted to learn from the best I guess."

Typing out someone's code or words, character by character really helps you understand their thought process. Why did they do it this way and not the other way? 

## Copying Taste

For me, copying work, is connected to developing *taste*. 

*Taste* in the broadest sense. Its developing a feeling for **what is good**. A feeling, fluid, different for everybody, can't be measured or optimized.

To me it feels like copying from someone with great *taste* rubs off on me. I inherit a small part of their *taste*. I maybe can't reproduce it on my own, or in an other context (yet), but I do know how it could look like, and I know their is a [gap](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish).

Developing taste is the most important thing to do great work.

> “All of us who do creative [great] work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you... Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this... It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.”

Develop taste, do lots of work, create great things.
